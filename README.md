# Data Analysis Using Python

ðŸ”· In this project, I show how to work on a real project of Data Analysis with Python.

ðŸ”· Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python.

ðŸ”· It is a project of Data Analysis with Python or Data Science with Python.

The commands that I used in this project :

ðŸ”´ head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).

ðŸ”´ shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the data frame

ðŸ”´ index - This attribute provides the index of the data frame

ðŸ”´ columns - It shows the name of each column

ðŸ”´ dtypes - It shows the data type of each column

ðŸ”´ unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied to a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.

ðŸ”´ nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as to the whole dataframe.

ðŸ”´ count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole data frame.

ðŸ”´ value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied to a single column only.

ðŸ”´ info() - Provides basic information about the dataframe.
